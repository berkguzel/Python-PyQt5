# Python-PyQt5

I tried to make a desktop app to take notes under tags by using Python and MongoDb.It holds article count as
read count or unread count in database according to your decision and if you clicked to see what you read you can 
see your topics about what you read on graph. Graph was created by using Matplotlib.
